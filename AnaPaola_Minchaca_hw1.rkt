; FUNCTION: is-triangle? determines if the lengths make a valid triangle
; INPUT: the length of three sides
; OUTPUT: returns a boolean

(define (is-triangle? a b c)
  (cond
    [(and (> (+ a b) c) (> (+ b c) a) (> (+ c a) b)) #t] ; valid if two sides are greater than the third side
    [(or (<= a 0) (<= b 0) (<= c 0)) #f] ; not valid if sides are lower than 0
    (else #f)))

; FUNCTION: triangle-type determines the type of the triangle
; INPUT: the length of three sides using the is-triangle function
; OUTPUT: returns 'INVALID, 'EQUILATERAL, 'ISOCELES, 'SCALENE

(define (triangle-type a b c)
  (cond
    [(not (is-triangle? a b c)) 'INVALID] ; it is not a valid triangle

    [(or (= a b) (= b c) (= c a)) 'ISOCELES] ; any of it's two sides are equal
    (else 'SCALENE)))

; FUNCTION: point-quadrant see the quadrant where the 2D point is located
; INPUT: the coordinates of a 2D point
; OUTPUT: returns 'ORIGIN, 'X_AXIS, 'Y_AXIS, 'I, 'II, 'III, 'IV

    (else 'ORIGIN))) ; otherwise it is on the origin

; FUNCTION: parking-ticket determines how much you should pay in a parking lot
